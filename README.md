# Eggcrypt

Jailbroken iOS tweak & desktop powercord plugin which encrypts Discord messages to empower citizens to evade censorship by The Communist Party of China and democratize the regional communications infrastructure.  

## How NFTs and eggcrypt can contribute to the fight for freedom in China
Eggcrypt uses an in-house pseudo-Mandarin encoding solution to provide plaussible deniability for your encrypted messages. Users of the novel Bejing Project Eggcrypt have industry-standard encryption that prevents people without the key from seeing the encrypted message. State actors who try and read the unencrypted message are none-the-wiser of any encryption used and will simply see nonsense unreadable chinese. NFTs are immutable. Protestors can use NFTs to send messages that can't be altered or hidden by state actors, an invaluable tool for freedom fighters organizing protests.
